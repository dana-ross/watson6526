# watson6526

Abandoned attempt at re-creating the MOS 6526 Complex Interface Adapter from the Commodore 64 in VHDL. This was never synthesized and probably doesn't work. It's definitely not as efficient as it could be, since it's a hardware definition written by a software guy. But I had fun writing it and didn't want to just throw the code away. So it's here if anybody wants it.
